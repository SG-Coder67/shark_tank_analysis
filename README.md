# shark_tank_analysis

Tools Used: Python(pandas),Tableau
Dataset: Shark Tank US dataset.csv(1441 pitches)

The project involved loading the raw data into Python (Pandas) for cleaning, where missing values were filled (0 for numbers, "Unknown" for text) and unused columns were dropped. cleaned dataset: cleaned_shark_tank.csv

The cleaned CSV was then analyzed to calculate key metrics (success rates, top investors)
