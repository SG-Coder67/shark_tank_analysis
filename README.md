Tools Used: Python(pandas),Tableau
Dataset: Shark Tank US dataset.csv(1441 pitches)

The project involved loading the raw data into Python (Pandas) for cleaning, where missing values were filled (0 for numbers, "Unknown" for text) and unused columns were dropped. cleaned dataset: cleaned_shark_tank.csv
